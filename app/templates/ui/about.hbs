        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Jonathan spent more time in college building, fixing, and playing on computers than he ever did studying for his erstwhile major of Political Science. In retrospect, he should have realized his true passion was software development much earlier than he did. But eventually (especially after discovering Ruby) Jon fully embraced the way of the nerd.</p>
